This program takes direct access of the framebuffer for fullscreen so does not work within a graphical desktop.
However, it is easy to switch out of the desktop by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1 to change to a virtual console.
You can switch back to the desktop by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F7 when done.

This is a work in progress:
  Audio not currently supported on the pi4 branch.
  Graphics currently don't display (other than the background colour).
